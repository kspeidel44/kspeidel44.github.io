    <h1>Hello There!</h1>

    <h2>My name is Katie and this is my first ever website made on my own.</h2>

    <p>I am a UX Designer based in New York City, and was interested in learning more about the development world. I wanted to take this course to become a better designer and communicator.</p>

    <h3>A Bit About Me</h3>

    <p>I moved to New York 4 months ago to pursue a career in UX Design. I previously worked for Nike's Run Club App as a Quality Assurance Analyst, working with athletes to ensure the highest quality product.</p>
